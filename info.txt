GHCN (Global Historical Climatology Network) – Daily Documentation
NOTE: English units are displayed on pdf output format; Either Metric or standard English units on csv
or txt output formats depending on user specification.
I. Description
GHCN (Global Historical Climatology Network)-Daily is a database that addresses the critical need for
historical daily temperature, precipitation, and snow records over global land areas. GHCN-Daily is a
composite of climate records from numerous sources that were merged and then subjected to a suite of
quality assurance reviews. The archive includes over 40 meteorological elements (see Table 4 below for
complete list) including temperature daily maximum/minimum, temperature at observation time,
precipitation, snowfall, snow depth, evaporation, wind movement, wind maximums, soil temperature,
cloudiness, and more.
GHCN-Daily will serve as a replacement product for older NCDC-maintained data sets that are
designated for daily temporal resolution (i.e. DSI 3200, DSI 3201, DSI 3202, DSI 3205, DSI 3206, DSI 3208,
DSI 3210, etc.). It will function as the official archive for daily data from the Global Climate Observing
System (GCOS) Surface Network (GSN) and is particularly well suited for monitoring and assessment
activities related to the frequency and magnitude of extremes. Containing observations of one or more
of the above elements at more than 100,000 stations that are distributed across all continents, the
dataset is the world's largest collection of daily climatological data. The total of 1.4 billion data values
includes 250 million values each for maximum and minimum temperatures, 500 million precipitation
totals, and 200 million observations each for snowfall and snow depth. Station records, some of which
extend back to the 19th century, are updated daily where possible and are usually available one to two
days after the date and time of the observation.
Some of the data provided here are based on data exchanged under the World Meteorological
Organization (WMO) World Weather Watch Program according to WMO Resolution 40 (Cg-XII). This
allows WMO member countries to place restrictions on the use or re-export of their data for commercial
purposes outside of the receiving country. Those countries' data summaries and products which are
available here are intended for free and unrestricted use in research, education, and other noncommercial activities. For non-U.S. locations data, the data or any derived product shall not be provided
to other users or be used for the re-export of commercial services.
II. Format/Observation Definitions
(note: the term ‘element ’or ‘value’ is used throughout this documentation and refers to an individual
meteorological/climatological measurement or statistical value such as temperature, precipitation (amount), etc.)
Users are given the choice between the following two delivery formats:
1) GHCN-Daily Form- Portable Document Format (PDF) output giving 5 core values (see Table 4)
and, if available, the following additional values: TOBS (temperature at the time of observation),
EVAP (evaporation of water from evaporation pan), WDMV (24-hour wind movement), SN*#
(minimum soil temperature) and SX*# (maximum soil temperature). More details about these
values are in Table 4 (below). There are no flags (attributes) given with the GHCN- Daily Form
pdf file other than measurement flag “T” (trace value for precipitation, snowfall or snow depth,
as per table 3 below). Units for data values can be in metric or standard depending on user
preference for both CSV and text output. Empty, or blank, cells indicate that a data observation
was not reported.
2) Custom GHCN-Daily CSV- Output files contain .csv extension and optimized for spreadsheet
usage (i.e. delimited file). Besides unit preference, user is also given the choice whether to
include flags, station name or geographic location in data request. The user can define which of
the elements listed in Table 4 (below) to include in the data request.
3) Custom GHCN-Daily ASCII Form-Output is ASCII text file and the user is given the choice whether
to include flags, station name or geographic location in data request. The user can define which
of the elements listed in Table 4 (below) to include in the data request.
A. Data observations (values)
Each record represents all selected observations (values) available for a given station-day. The initial
section of each record is ordered as follows with the following definitions:
STATION (17 characters) is the station identification code. Please see
http://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/ghcnd-stations.txt
for a complete list of stations and their metadata.
STATION_NAME (max 50 characters) is the name of the station (usually city/airport name). Optional
output field.
GEOGRAPHIC_LOCATION (31 characters) is the latitude (decimated degrees w/northern hemisphere
values > 0, southern hemisphere values < 0), longitude (decimated degrees w/western hemisphere
values < 0, eastern hemisphere values > 0) and elevation above mean sea level (tenths of meters). This is
an optional output field.
DATE is the year of the record (4 digits) followed by month (2 digits) and day (2 digits).
B. Observations (values) and flags (attributes)
Following this initial section of the record, all selected observations and flags are given in the following
order:
Observation(s) | Measurement Flag | Quality Flag | Source Flag | Time of Observation | repeat for next
element (when more than one element is selected), where:
Observation(s) is/are defined in Table 4 below. 9’s in a field (e.g.9999) indicate missing data or data that
has not been received.
Measurement Flag (attribute) is defined in Table 1 below
Quality Flag (attribute) is defined in Table 2 below
Source Flag (attribute) is defined in Table 3 below
Time of Observation is the (2 digit hour, 2 digit minute) 24 hour clock time of the observation given as
the local time at the station of record.
Note: The 4 flags listed above are optional on the Custom GHCN-Daily ASCII Form.
